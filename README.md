# SinaraX is a TUI for the [sinaraml](https://github.com/4-DS/sinaraml) library

## Motivation

It is convenient to have a cli, but it is even more convenient to have a graphical interface for managing this cli.  
As a regular user of [sinaraml](https://github.com/4-DS), I have developed a basic version of the sinaraX library.  
It covers the capabilities of managing servers in [sinaraml](https://github.com/4-DS/sinaraml) without using commands in the console.  

## Installation

```bash
pip install sinaraX
```

## Quick Start
